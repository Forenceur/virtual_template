# virtual_template

This is a solution if you want to use template with a pure virtual method c++
That the case if you don't store the template in your object, otherwise you've type erasure.

I don't know if it's the best solution, or if use this stuff mean having a architecture issue, but I hope it will be useful for somebody.
